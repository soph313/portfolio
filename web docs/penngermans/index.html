        <h1 class="header">What We Carry in Wood and Dust</h1>
        <p>When I think of my grandparents’ farm in Pennsylvania, I think of the objects in their home. Not because these objects are rare or expensive — they aren't — but because they've <em>lasted generations,</em> because of how they hold memories decades old. Through moves and seasons, through grief and celebration, they endured.</p>
        <p>Pennsylvania German furniture was built to last. Thick timbers. Sturdy joints. Painted motifs with meanings passed down like recipes. But the real weight of these objects was never just physical. They've held memory. They've held people.</p>
        <p>This is a story told through three of them — a chair, a hope chest, a star.</p>

          <h1 class="header">My chair at the dining table</h1>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block" id="baking-block">
          <p>That chair creaked — always, no matter who sat in it.</p>
          <p id="gmaBro">Sticky with blueberry juice, tired from baking pies with my grandma and little brother, I'd sink into it.
            <br>I'd look up and see the two of them smiling at me, enjoying those lovely moments with family.</p>
          <img src="image/ColinNGmaBaking.png" alt="Baking with Grandma" />
          <p>There's a part of me that hopes blueberry juice stains are still on that chair. That it rememebers as I do.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block">
          <p>Grandma picked the berries with me, from her blueberry bushes on the part of their property where grass turned to woods. I remember the way she moved, patient, knowing which ones were ripe just by how they gave under her fingers.
          </p>
            <img src="image/blueberryPicking.png" alt="Berry Bushes" />
          <p>I remember the way she laughed when I picked too many and they spilled all over the ground.
            <br>And I remember the way she said, “You’ll get it next time.”
            <br> She taught me to pick berries. But, she also taught me that it’s okay to spill a few berries along the way.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block" id="pie-block">
          <p>In that chair, she taught me to make crust — the good kind, where the butter's cold and the dough sings when it rolls out right. 
            <br><br>She taught me to love the process of making something with my hands.
            <br>I’ve made dozens of pies with her recipe since. For friends. For birthdays. For no reason at all. </p>
          <img src="image/BakingPie.png" alt="Rolling Dough" />
          <p>But no pie has tasted like the ones we made together. 
            <br>I think the chair remembers. I think it might still smell faintly of flour and love. It’s a chair that holds the memories of generations of family. Of laughter. Of blueberry juice and flour and love.</p>

          <img src="image/linen.png" alt="linens" />
          <p>It lived at the foot of the bed — this heavy thing, full of linens and lace, of traditions folded tightly and tucked away.</p>
          <p>When I was little, I climbed inside and closed the lid, just to see what dreams lived in the dark. I fell asleep there once. The smell of cherry, the hush, the way the air felt — still and holy.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block" id="blanket-block">
          <p>It was meant to hold a future — trousseau linens, a dowry, the life you were supposed to build.</p>
          <img src="image/blanket.png" alt="Hope chest in sunlight" />
          <p>But my grandmother repurposed it. Old family blankets. My dad’s childhood clothes. Even letters, once — careful, cursive words sealed with time.  We keep what we think we’ll need. Sometimes we keep what we’re not ready to let go of. I like to think that chest still holds a little of my kid-self — dreaming new dreams inside old wood.</p>

          <img id="theStar" src="image/Barnstar.png" alt="Old barn on the property" />
          <p>There’s a barn on the edge of the property — it used to hold animals, now it holds history.  And above its door, painted in fading red and black, a five-point star.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block barn-blocks">
          <img src="image/oldBarn.png" alt="Five-point star above barn" />
          <p>On road trips through Pennsylvania, we'd pass by barns with five point stars. I remembering asking my grandparents what the stars meant. “Good luck,” said my grandfather. “Protection,” said my grandmother. That’s how they were — same object, different faiths and perspective, but always both right.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="content-block barn-blocks" >
          <img src="image/colinni.png" alt="Child holding metal star" />
          <p>When I was five, she gave me a small metal one. I hung it on my wall like it was sacred. And maybe it was. It still hangs there now. An artifact from my childhood.
            <br><br> Whenever I see it, I think of the summers my brother and I spent with my grandparents. We'd run up and down the hill on their property all day, help them tame the weeds in the garden, plant flowers with my grandma — loved memories.

        <div class="content-block barn-blocks">
          <img src="image/barn.png" alt="Interior of barn" />
          <p>That barn’s full of old tools and wood shavings, with dust and memories. My dad’s childhood carved into beams. The star doesn’t shine anymore. But it doesn’t have to. It still watches. It still protects.</p>

          <p>And in the stories we tell — and retell — each time we let memory settle like dust on a well-worn chair.</p>
