    <p>hi! i'm soph & this is my IN PROGRESS portfolio website!</p>
    <p>
        right now it just links to portfolio projects while i work on building<br>
        up the website to look prettier & be more interactive. thanks for your patience!
        <br> <br> also! i'm working on making these mobile optimized. <br>
        how to say goodbye, and squirreling around are decently mobile friendly,
        <br> the quiltmaker unfortunately isn't there yet
    </p>

    <p>
        PSA: since this home page isn't clean n pretty, you cant access it from 
        <br>this page except through the back button or the website domain!
        <br> <br>
        sooo.....keep that in mind...........and have fun with my little projects!!
